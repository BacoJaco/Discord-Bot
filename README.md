.j time: Putting in a time (8am, 12pm) returns a greeting to match (ie. Good morning!)

.j randomImage: Returns a random image of an over-sized rubber duck

(These are more "useful" functions):

.j eightBall: Put in a question to get a mystical answer

.j RPS, .j rps, or .j Rps: Enter 'rock', 'paper', or 'scissors' and play against the bot

.j trivia: Either multiple choice (type multiple) or true/false (type boolean) trivia questions

.j number: Returns a fun fact about the given number
